#Generate 4k pattern using this python script

Image size determined by 'Image.new((mode),[size],(color))'

Change second parameter of img.putPixel (0xsomething) to adjust desired color

Output patter is checkerboard

Change output directory by changing path in img.save() call at end of script

This is definitely the slow way to do it...but it works
